# Spark NLP Classification For Coronavirus Using LSTM
## I. Outline
- Coronavirus has changed our lives and the way we live everyday. There has been a lot of loss for people and property. And we can't efford it.
- Thanks to the unprecedented strong development of vaccines, along with the awareness of vaccination and wearing masks at all times, we have partly controlled the epidemic to re-develop the economy. However, community awareness is still the top criterion to ensure safe coexistence in the context that the epidemic cannot end soon.
- This project is made using a dataset taken from twitter in 2020, during the worst covid epidemic in history. Through people's tweets, this project (for learning purposes) tries to predict their emotions to understand how they felt during that difficult time.
## II. Business Objective/ Problem
- Let's say you work in the Data Science department at Twitter. In 2020, there are many tweets every day mentioning the pandemic situation of people where they live and their feelings at that time. Your task is to build a model that predicts users' emotions through the words in their tweets.
- This project builds on that requirement
## III. Project implementation
### 1. Business Understanding
Based on the above description => identify the problem:
- Find a solution to analyze users' emotions through what they write in tweets
- Objectives/problems: build a model that can classify users' emotions through tweets. From there, understand the emotional of users, and can take actions to support them in emergancy cases.
- Applied methods:
